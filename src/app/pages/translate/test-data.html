                                    <h3>Make something amazing, for anyone</h3>
                                    <p>Drupal is content management software. It's
                                        used to make many of the websites and
                                        applications you use every day. Drupal has
                                        great standard features, like easy content
                                        authoring, reliable performance, and
                                        excellent security. But what sets it apart
                                        is its flexibility; modularity is one of its
                                        core principles. Its tools help you build
                                        the versatile, structured content that
                                        dynamic web experiences need.</p>
                                    <p>It's also a great choice for creating
                                        integrated digital frameworks. You can
                                        extend it with any one, or many, of
                                        thousands of add-ons. Modules expand
                                        Drupal's functionality. Themes let you
                                        customize your content's presentation.
                                        Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles
                                        you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match
                                        these components to enhance Drupal's core
                                        abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with
                                        external services and other applications in
                                        your infrastructure. No other content
                                        management software is this powerful and
                                        scalable.</p>
                                    <p>The Drupal project is open source software.
                                        Anyone can download, use, work on, and share
                                        it with others. It's built on principles
                                        like collaboration, globalism, and
